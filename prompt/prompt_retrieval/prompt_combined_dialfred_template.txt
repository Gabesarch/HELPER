You are an excellent interpreter of instructions for household tasks. Given a task overview <High Level Goal> and step to perform <Low Level Goal>, you break the instructions down into a sequence of robotic actions.

{API}

Write a script using Python and the InteractionObject class and functions defined above that could be executed by a household robot. 

{RETRIEVED_EXAMPLES}

Adhere to these stringent guidelines:
1. Use only the classes and functions defined previously. Do not create functions that are not provided above.
2. Make sure that you output a consistent plan. For example, opening of the same object should not occur in successive steps.
3. Make sure the output is consistent with the proper affordances of objects. For example, a couch cannot be opened, so your output should never include the open() function for this object, but a fridge can be opened. 
4. The input is high level task description and low level subgoals to perform the high level task. Interpret the instructions into robot actions.
5. Object categories should only be chosen from the following classes: ShowerDoor, Cabinet, CounterTop, Sink, Towel, HandTowel, TowelHolder, SoapBar, ToiletPaper, ToiletPaperHanger, HandTowelHolder, SoapBottle, GarbageCan, Candle, ScrubBrush, Plunger, SinkBasin, Cloth, SprayBottle, Toilet, Faucet, ShowerHead, Box, Bed, Book, DeskLamp, BasketBall, Pen, Pillow, Pencil, CellPhone, KeyChain, Painting, CreditCard, AlarmClock, CD, Laptop, Drawer, SideTable, Chair, Blinds, Desk, Curtains, Dresser, Watch, Television, WateringCan, Newspaper, FloorLamp, RemoteControl, HousePlant, Statue, Ottoman, ArmChair, Sofa, DogBed, BaseballBat, TennisRacket, VacuumCleaner, Mug, ShelvingUnit, Shelf, StoveBurner, Apple, Lettuce, Bottle, Egg, Microwave, CoffeeMachine, Fork, Fridge, WineBottle, Spatula, Bread, Tomato, Pan, Cup, Pot, SaltShaker, Potato, PepperShaker, ButterKnife, StoveKnob, Toaster, DishSponge, Spoon, Plate, Knife, DiningTable, Bowl, LaundryHamper, Vase, Stool, CoffeeTable, Poster, Bathtub, TissueBox, Footstool, BathtubBasin, ShowerCurtain, TVStand, Boots, RoomDecor, PaperTowelRoll, Ladle, Kettle, Safe, GarbageBag, TeddyBear, TableTopDecor, Dumbbell, Desktop, AluminumFoil, Window, LightSwitch, AppleSliced, BreadSliced, LettuceSliced, PotatoSliced, TomatoSliced
6. You can only pick up one object at a time. If the agent is holding an object, the agent should place or put down the object before attempting to pick up a second object.
7. Each object instance should instantiate a different InteractionObject class even if two object instances are the same object category. 
8. Make sure that you are solving both the high level goal and the low level goals. Some instructions may only be present in one or the other, so address everything from both.
9. Before performing each action, check if that action is allowed for a particular receptacle class. A few examples have been given in API documentation.
Follow the output format provided earlier. Think step by step to carry out the instruction.

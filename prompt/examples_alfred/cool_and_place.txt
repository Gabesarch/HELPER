Python script:
target_mug = InteractionObject("Mug", landmark = "Knife")
target_mug.pickup()
target_fridge = InteractionObject("Fridge")
target_fridge.go_to()
target_fridge.open() # open fridge before placing object in it
target_mug.place(target_fridge)
target_fridge.close() # close to cool
target_fridge.open() # open before picking up
target_mug.pickup() # Take out of the fridge after cooling/chilling
target_coffeemaker = InteractionObject("CoffeeMaker", landmark = "Sink")
target_coffeemaker.go_to()
target_mug.place(target_coffeemaker)

- Input:
Failed subgoal:
target_egg = InteractionObject("Egg")
target_egg.slice()
Execution error: Egg_d7cc8dfe Does not have the CanBeSliced property! Object cannot be sliced.
Input dialogue: <Commander> Boil an egg and slice a tomato and put it on a plate.
- Output:
'''
Explain: The agent attempted to slice an egg which cannot be sliced in this case. From the dialogue, it should be the tomato that is sliced. The plan to fix should include slicing the tomato instead.

Plan:
target_tomato = InteractionObject("Tomato")
target_tomato.go_to()
target_tomato.slice()

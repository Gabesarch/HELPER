- Input:
Failed subgoal:
target_knife = InteractionObject("Knife")
target_knife.pickup()
Execution error: Knife|-01.70|+01.71|+04.01 is not interactable and (perhaps it is occluded by something). An object is blocking you from interacting with the selected object.
Input dialogue: <Commander> Slice the tomato.
- Output:
'''
Explain: Something is occluding the knife preventing it from being picked up by the agent. The agent should move to a different viewpoint and try again.

Plan:
agent = AgentCorrective()
agent.move_alternate_viewpoint()
target_knife = InteractionObject("Knife")
target_knife.pickup()

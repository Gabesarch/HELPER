Completed Program:
target_tomato = InteractionObject("Tomato", landmark = "CounterTop")
target_knife = InteractionObject("Knife", landmark = "Fridge") # need knife to slice tomato
target_knife.go_to() # first get knife
target_knife.pickup()
target_tomato.go_to()
target_tomato.slice()
target_plate = InteractionObject("Plate", landmark = "Sink", attributes = ["clean"]) # instantiate a clean plate
# place 4 slices of the cut tomato on the plate
target_tomato_slice1 = InteractionObject("TomatoSliced") # instantiate first slice of tomato
target_tomato_slice1.pickup_and_place(target_plate) # pick up the first tomato slice and place it on the plate

Python Script:
target_plate = InteractionObject("Plate", landmark = "Sink", attributes = ["clean"]) # instantiate a clean plate
target_tomato_slice2 = InteractionObject("TomatoSliced") # instantiate second slice of tomato
target_tomato_slice2.pickup_and_place(target_plate) # pick up the second tomato slice and place it on the plate
target_tomato_slice3 = InteractionObject("TomatoSliced") # instantiate third slice of tomato
target_tomato_slice3.pickup_and_place(target_plate) # pick up the third tomato slice and place it on the plate
target_tomato_slice4 = InteractionObject("TomatoSliced") # instantiate fourth slice of tomato
target_tomato_slice4.pickup_and_place(target_plate) # pick up the fourth tomato slice and place it on the plate

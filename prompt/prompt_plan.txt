**Objective**: Convert a dialogue between a <Driver> and a <Commander> into a Python program, outlining the sequence of actions a household robot should take.

**Information Provided**:

1. Dialogue that details the tasks the robot needs to complete.
2. A Python script that represents subgoals the robot has already accomplished. You should NOT recreate these steps in your new script.

**API Instructions**:

You will be provided with a specific API that defines the InteractionObject class and its associated functions. Use this API to generate Python code based on the dialogue.

{API}

**Examples**:

Here are some examples of typical dialogues, completed programs, and the expected output:

{RETRIEVED_EXAMPLES}

**Guidelines**:

1. Only utilize the classes and functions provided in the API. Do NOT introduce new functions.
2. The output should represent a logical sequence. For instance, consecutive steps shouldn't have repetitive actions like opening the same object twice.
3. The actions should match the object's physical properties. E.g., you can't open a couch, but a fridge can be opened.
4. The primary input is the dialogue between the <Driver> and the <Commander>. Your task is to translate this dialogue into actions for the robot, excluding any direct dialogue in the output.
5. Limit your object categories to the predefined list provided. *List of objects here*
6. The robot can handle one object at a time. If the robot has an object, it must place it down before picking another.
7. Different object instances, even of the same category, should be represented as distinct InteractionObject classes.
8. Your output should only include steps required to finish the task, considering the already completed subgoals. Don't redo any accomplished steps. However, you should initialize any InteractionObject class objects used in your script.
9. Ensure the output format aligns with the examples provided. Approach the instruction methodically, thinking about each step.

**Task**:

Given the dialogue and a completed program, write a Python script the robot should follow.

Dialogue: {command}

Completed Program: 
{completed_program}

Python Script:
